                                If you can agree to all the conditions above, please let me know immediately. As our beloved friend MAMRO agreed to bear all the epxenses becuase this is pretty unexpected for him that he finally found a girl that he had never thought of. There's a lot of planning involved here so I'd like to have everyone's names confirmed ASAP. I guarantee you will enjoy yourselves. This is gonna be EPIC!!!
